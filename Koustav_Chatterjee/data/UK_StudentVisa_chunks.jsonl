Note that throughout this document, references to EEA nationals \ninclude Swiss nationals and excludes Irish nationals.  Irish nationals have a specific \nstatus in the UK under section 3ZA of the Immigration Act 1971. Full details are set \nout in the Irish citizens section of this guidance. \n \nDependent partners and children can apply on this route (with some exceptions for \ndependants of care workers, senior care workers and medium skilled roles) as set \nout in the dependant’s guidance. Non-POISE users can find the externally published \nversion of this guidance on GOV.UK. \n \nThe route can lead to settlement in the UK. \n \nThe route replaces the Tier 2 (General) route. Existing Tier 2 (General) workers can \napply for extensions, changes of employment and settlement under the Skilled \nWorker route. \n \nRequirements \nThe requirements applicants must meet are split into 3 parts: \n \n1. validity requirements– these outline the minimum criteria which must be met \nfor the application to be considered fully. They ensure, for example, the \napplicant has used the correct form and supplied their identity documents. \nApplications which do not meet these requirements are invalid and may be \nrejected. \n2. suitability requirements– these check the suitability of the applicant to be \ngranted any form of permission, not specifically whether they qualify as a \nSkilled Worker. Applicants must not fall for refusal on general grounds or be in \nbreach of immigration laws. Applications which do not meet these \nrequirements must be refused. \n3. eligibility requirements – these are the main criteria specific to the Skilled \nWorker route. Applications which do not meet these requirements must be \nrefused. \n \nThe table below sets out the paragraphs in Appendix Skilled Worker for each of \nthese requirements: \n \nApplication \nValidity \nSuitability"}
